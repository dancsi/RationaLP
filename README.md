# RationaLP
## Rational dense linear program solver

To run the solver, execute
```
RationaLP input.txt [--pivot {bland, random or maxincrease}] [--verbose]
```
Note that in order to build the solver, you need Boost and GMP/MPIR installed somewhere where CMake can find them. On Debian-based systems, one would install `libboost-dev libboost-program-options-dev libgmp-dev`.

The input format is as follows:
```
n
m
c1 c2 ... cn
b1 b2 ... bm
a11 a12 ... a1n
a21 a22 ... a2n
...
am1 am2 ... amn
```
The problem that is solved is 
```
    max  c^T x
    s.t. A x <= b
           x >= 0
```

There are no restrictions on the range or number of (rational) variables, however, take note that each pivot step takes O(number of variables * number of constraints) time.

Some tests are provided in the `inputs/` directory, and more can be generated by the following scripts

- `generate_random.py n m`, that generates a random feasible, unbounded and infeasible instance with `n` variables and `m` constraints
- `generate_klee_minty.py n`, that generates the [Klee-Minty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klee%E2%80%93Minty_cube) hypercube of dimension `n`
- `generate_vertex_cover.py n m`, that generates a random graph with `n` vertices and `m` edges, and outputs the LP relaxation of the corresponding vertex cover problem

In order to verify that the solver works correctly, its output can be compared against the output of [Gurobi](http://www.gurobi.com/), using `test.py`. In order for the tests to work, one must have a valid Gurobi licence, and the Python API installed. The easiest way to to so is to [install the `gurobi` package in Anaconda](http://www.gurobi.com/documentation/current/quickstart_windows/installing_the_anaconda_py.html#section:Anaconda).
